**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage**

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration:** Start Time: November 1, 2023, 09:00 AM (UTC) | End Time: November 1, 2023, 01:00 PM (UTC)
- **Impact:**
  - Unavailability of the main web application.
  - 75% of users experienced service degradation.
- **Root Cause:** Database connection pool exhaustion leading to server crashes.

**Timeline:**
- **Detection Time:** November 1, 2023, 09:15 AM (UTC)
- **Detection Method:** Automated monitoring triggered an alert for increased server errors.
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Investigated server logs to identify the source of errors.
  - Assumed an issue with database connections due to the error patterns.
- **Misleading Paths:**
  - Initially suspected a DDoS attack due to the sudden surge in traffic.
  - Explored application code for potential bugs causing the errors.
- **Escalation:**
  - Incident escalated to the DevOps and Database teams.
- **Resolution:**
  - Temporarily increased the database connection pool to handle the load.
  - Implemented a rolling restart of application servers to apply the configuration change.
  - Monitored server logs and database performance for any signs of anomalies.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Root Cause:**
  - The database connection pool size was not configured to handle peak traffic.
  - A sudden increase in user activity led to the exhaustion of available connections.
- **Resolution:**
  - Increased the database connection pool size to ensure sufficient capacity.
  - Implemented a mechanism to dynamically adjust the pool size based on traffic patterns.
  - Conducted a thorough code review to identify and fix any inefficient database queries.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements/Fixes:**
  - Implement proactive monitoring for database connection usage.
  - Conduct regular load testing to identify potential scaling issues.
- **Tasks:**
  1. **Database Connection Pool Configuration:** Update and optimize the configuration for the database connection pool to accommodate peak loads.
  2. **Automated Scaling:** Implement an automated scaling solution to adjust resources based on traffic patterns.
  3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring systems to provide early detection of abnormal activity and potential bottlenecks.
  4. **Documentation:** Update documentation to include detailed procedures for handling similar incidents in the future.
  5. **Training:** Conduct training sessions for the team to ensure a faster and more accurate response to incidents.

**Conclusion:**
The outage was a result of underestimating the potential surge in user activity and inadequate preparation of the database connection pool. By addressing the root cause and implementing corrective measures, we aim to enhance the system's resilience and minimize the impact of similar incidents in the future. Regular monitoring, proactive scaling, and continuous improvement in response procedures will be key focuses to ensure the stability and reliability of our web stack.
